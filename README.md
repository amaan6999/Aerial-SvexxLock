# Aerial-SvexxLock
An installer for enabling use of Locking the PC and running the Aerial Screensaver
I have simply written an executable in c++ and compiled the required files in the installer to allow the user to lock the screen and have the screensaver execute right after.
Installer compiler credits go to Inno Setup.
Exe was compiled in CodeBlocks under GNU License http://www.codeblocks.org/
Icon Credits: Icon made by [Madebyoliver]- http://www.flaticon.com/authors/madebyoliver from www.flaticon.com 
I take no credit for the work John Coates has put in, and he is duly responsible for creating this beautiful screensaver.
All rights and credit go to him. Link below:

This program will not be used, shared or distributed for profit. I have just enabled easier use to lock windows and run the screensaver. 
Enjoy
