# Aerial-SvexxLock
An installer for enabling use of Locking the PC and running the Aerial Screensaver.
I have written the program in c++ and compiled the required files in the installer to allow the user to lock the screen and have the screensaver execute right after. This allows the user to let the footage run top of the lockscreen instead of under at will, leaving for gorgreus visuals whilst keeping the computer secure.
Installer was compiled using Inno Setup.
Exe was compiled in CodeBlocks under GNU License http://www.codeblocks.org/
